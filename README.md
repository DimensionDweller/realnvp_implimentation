## Background

Normalizing flows, such as RealNVP, have revolutionized density estimation and generative modeling. By providing invertible transformations, they enable exact likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and accurate modeling of complex distributions. RealNVP's architecture makes it a significant and versatile tool in various applications, such as anomaly detection, data synthesis, and more.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to implement RealNVP for modeling 2D distributions. It provides an in-depth exploration of the architectural components, including the affine coupling layers that define the model's behavior.

### Data Overview

The project utilizes synthetic 2D data generated through the `datasets.make_moons` function. The data is then normalized and transformed, ready to be modeled by the RealNVP implementation.

## Model Architecture

RealNVP's architecture is built upon a series of affine coupling layers that alternate between variables, performing invertible transformations. Below is a general overview of the key components:

### Affine Coupling Layer

The affine coupling layer is a core building block of RealNVP, responsible for performing a mixture of scaling and translation operations on the input variables. It utilizes a mask to separate the input into two parts, with one remaining unchanged and the other undergoing transformation.

### RealNVP Model

The overall RealNVP model is constructed using multiple affine coupling layers, arranged according to specified masks. The forward and inverse transformations enable conversion between observed variables and latent space variables.

## Results

Visualizations of the transformations and model's behavior can be observed throughout the training process. The project provides insights into how RealNVP transforms the input data, offering an intuitive understanding of its functionality.

## Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/RealNVP_2D.git
```

Navigate to the directory of the project:

```bash
cd RealNVP_2D
```

Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the main script to start training the model:

```bash
python train_realnvp.py
```

Adjust the hyperparameters as needed within the script.

## Future Work

The potential applications of RealNVP and normalizing flows are vast. Future work may include:

- Extending the implementation to higher-dimensional data.
- Exploring various architectures and coupling mechanisms.
- Integrating RealNVP into broader systems, such as variational inference frameworks.
